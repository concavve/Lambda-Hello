Hello: Introduction

Hi, My name is Anthony Gibbons and I am a student at Lambda!

3 words that describe me:
1. Initiative
2. Determined
3. Passionate

My name is Anthony and I am a 32 year old addiction counselor for at rish youth that is self taught in coding. I am currently a student at Lambda learning to code more efficiently so that I can find my dream job as a developer for a startup. I played baseball in college on a full ride scholarship to Delaware and was drafted and played for the Phillies for 2 years making it to AA. I absolutely love dogs, have 2 myself, and love to play video games if I ever have the time. As a developer I want to change the world with VR coding that allows others to experience space and the world like never before.
